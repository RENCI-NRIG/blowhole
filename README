The easy way to build (needs maven):

$ mvn clean package appassembler:assemble

produces an app that can be installed. The files are under target/appassembler/[bin/:repo/] - can be tar'ed/zipped etc. 
Creates both windows and unix-friendly start up shell scripts.

To run the app:

$ sh target/appassembler/bin/blowhole

When you run the first time it will complain that it can't find the config file and print out a sample file. 
The file goes either into /etc/blowhole/xmpp.properties or $HOME/.xmpp.properties.

Other ways to build/run:

$ mvn clean assembly:assembly

produces jar with dependencies. Then to run

java -jar ./target/pubsub-daemon-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

It can be run alternatively: 

java -cp ./target/pubsub-daemon-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.renci.pubsub_daemon.ManifestSubscriber

To stop use Ctrl-C (note that it may take a few seconds to cancel active subscriptions).

To delete all pubsub nodes (must be run on behalf of the publisher, not the subscribers):

java -cp ./target/pubsub-daemon-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.renci.pubsub_daemon.DeleteNodes
